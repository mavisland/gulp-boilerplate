## Documentation

Add your source files to the appropriate `src` subdirectories. Gulp will process and and compile them into `dist`.

### Styles

Files in the `src/styles` directory will be compiled to `dist/css`.

### Scripts

Put your JavaScript files in the `src/scripts` directory. Files placed directly in the `src/scripts` folder will compile directly to `dist/js` as both minified and unminified files.

## Options

### Paths

Adjust the `input`, `output`, `watch` paths for all of the Gulp tasks under the `paths` variable. Paths are relative to the root project folder.

```js
// Paths
const paths = {
  styles: {
    input: 'src/styles/*.scss',
    output: 'dist/css/',
    watch: 'src/styles/**/*.scss'
  },
  scripts: {
    input: 'src/scripts/*.js',
    output: 'dist/js/',
    watch: 'src/scripts/**/*.js'
  }
}
```
